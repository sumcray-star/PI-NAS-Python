# PI-NAS-Python

## Overview

This is a media server application built using Python, designed to connect with a Raspberry Pi that serves as a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. The application is developed on Replit and aims to provide web-based access to media files stored on the Pi NAS system.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Not yet determined from repository contents
- **Purpose**: Web application server to interface with Raspberry Pi NAS
- **Deployment**: Replit-based development and hosting

### Frontend Architecture
- **Interface**: Web-based interface (specific framework TBD)
- **Purpose**: User interface for accessing and managing media files

### Data Storage
- **Primary Storage**: Raspberry Pi NAS (external network storage)
- **Local Storage**: Minimal local storage on Replit for application data
- **Database**: Not yet implemented (may require database for metadata, user management, etc.)

## Key Components

### Media Server Core
- **Function**: Serves media files from the connected Raspberry Pi NAS
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - File discovery and indexing
  - Media streaming capabilities
  - File management operations

### Network Connection Module
- **Function**: Handles communication with Raspberry Pi NAS
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Network discovery and connection
  - Authentication with NAS device
  - File transfer protocols

### Web Interface
- **Function**: Provides user-friendly access to media files
- **Responsibilities**:
  - File browsing and navigation
  - Media playback controls
  - User authentication and session management

## Data Flow

1. **Connection Establishment**: Application connects to Raspberry Pi NAS over network
2. **File Discovery**: System scans and indexes available media files
3. **User Request**: User accesses web interface and requests media content
4. **File Retrieval**: Application fetches requested files from NAS
5. **Media Delivery**: Files are streamed or downloaded to user's browser

## External Dependencies

### Hardware Dependencies
- **Raspberry Pi**: Physical device serving as NAS
- **Network Infrastructure**: Local network connectivity between Replit and Pi

### Software Dependencies
- **Python Libraries**: TBD based on implementation needs
  - Network communication libraries
  - Media handling libraries
  - Web framework dependencies
- **Raspberry Pi Software**: NAS software stack on the Pi device

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit
- **Benefits**: 
  - Cloud-based development
  - Easy collaboration and sharing
  - Integrated hosting capabilities

### Production Considerations
- **Network Access**: Requires stable connection to Raspberry Pi NAS
- **Security**: Need to implement secure authentication and encrypted connections
- **Performance**: May need optimization for media streaming over network

## Current Status

The project is in early development phase with basic repository structure established. Key implementation decisions still need to be made regarding:

1. Web framework selection (Flask, Django, FastAPI, etc.)
2. Database integration for metadata and user management
3. Media streaming protocols and optimization
4. Authentication and security implementation
5. User interface design and functionality

## Next Steps

1. Choose and implement web framework
2. Establish connection protocols with Raspberry Pi NAS
3. Implement basic file browsing functionality
4. Add media playback capabilities
5. Implement user authentication and security measures
